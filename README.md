## About

```astro-rust``` is an MIT licensed library of algorithms useful for rigorous and accurate astronomical calculations.

It include things such as  planetary, solar and lunar positioning, corrections of precession, nutation, parallax, and aberration, calculating the physical ephemeris of Mars and Jupiter, finding the elements of rings of Saturn, finding position angles, illuminated fractions, visual magnitudes, and times of rise, set and transit for bodies on the celestial sphere. Even Pluto's position and orbit can be calculated accurately.

## Usage

* Include the crate ```astro``` in your code
  ```rust
  extern crate astro;

  use astro::*;
  ```

* Find the Julian day (the most important step for almost everything)
  ```rust
  // time of the Apollo 11 moon landing

  let day_of_month = time::DayOfMonth{day: 20,
				 			          hr : 20,
                                      min: 18,
                                      sec: 4.0,
                                      time_zone: 0.0 // at Greenwhich
                                     };

  let date = time::Date{year       : 1969,
                        month      : 7, // July
                        decimal_day: time::decimal_day(&day_of_month),
                        cal_type   : time::CalType::Gregorian};

  let julian_day = time::julian_day(&date);

  // to be super accurate, get the Julian Ephemeris day;
  // calculate delta T, or get an observed value of
  // delta T from the Astronomical Almanac

  let deltaT = time::approx_delta_t(date.year, date.month);

  let julian_ephm_day = time::julian_emph_day(julian_day, deltaT);
  ```

* Find the *geocentric* ecliptic coordinates and radius vector of the Sun
  ```rust
  let (sun_eq_point, rad_vec) = sun::geocen_ecl_pos(julian_day);

  // sun_eq_point.long    - ecliptic longitude (radians)
  // sun_eq_point.lat     - ecliptic latitude (radians)
  // rad_vec - distance between the Sun and the Earth (AU)
  ```

* Similarly for the Moon
  ```rust
  let (long, lat, rad_vec) = lunar::geocen_ecl_pos(julian_day);
  ```

* Find the *heliocentric* coordinates and radius vector of Jupiter
  ```rust
  let (long, lat, rad_vec) = planet::heliocen_pos(&planet::Planet::Jupiter, julian_day);
  ```

* Find the corrections for nutation in ecliptic longitude and obliquity of the ecliptic
  ```rust
  let (nut_in_long, nut_in_oblq) = nutation::nutation(julian_day);
  ```

* Find the geodesic distance between two locations on the Earth
  ```rust
	// geodesic distance between the Observatoire de Paris and
    // the US Naval Observatory at Washington DC

    let paris = coords::GeographPoint{long: angle::deg_frm_dms(-2, 20, 14.0).to_radians(),
                                      lat : angle::deg_frm_dms(48, 50, 11.0).to_radians()};

    let washington = coords::GeographPoint{long: angle::deg_frm_dms(77,  3, 56.0).to_radians(),
                                           lat : angle::deg_frm_dms(38, 55, 17.0).to_radians()};

	// angle::deg_frm_dms() converts degrees expressed in degrees,
	// minutes and seconds into degrees with decimals

    let distance = planet::earth::geodesic_dist(&paris, &washington); // in meters
  ```

* Convert equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates
  ```rust
	// equatorial coordinates of the star Pollux

    let right_ascension = 116.328942_f64.to_radians();
    let declination = 28.026183_f64.to_radians();

    // mean obliquity of the ecliptic

    let oblq_eclip = 23.4392911_f64.to_radians();

    // you can also get oblq_eclip from ecliptic::MnOblq_IAU(julian_day)
    // for the same Julian day when the coordinates of the star
    // were observed

    // also make sure to type #[macro_use] before including the crate
    // to use macros

    // now, convert equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates

    let (ecl_long, ecl_lat) = EclFrmEq!(right_ascension, declination, oblq_eclip);
  ```

* Convert equatorial coordinates to galactic coordinates
  ```rust
	// equatorial coordinates of the Nova Serpentis 1978

    let right_ascension = angle::deg_frm_hms(17, 48, 59.74).to_radians();
    let declination = angle::deg_frm_dms(-14, 43, 8.2).to_radians();

    // convert to galactic coordinates

    let (gal_long, gal_lat) = GalFrmEq!(right_ascension, declination);
  ```

## Why

Most of the algorithms implemented here are those described in *Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus*, a book that has long been a well-respected and comprehensive source of astronomical algorithms. [Several](http://www.naughter.com/aa.html) [code libraries](http://mhuss.com/AstroLib/docs/Overview.html) based off the book have existed for a long time, being implemented in popular languages like [C/C++](http://www.projectpluto.com/source.htm), [Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astronomia/0.4.1) and [Java](http://celestjava.sourceforge.net/), which have had well-tested coverage of various algorithms, although sometimes distributed with slightly restrictive licenses.

This library however is written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/); a modern systems programming language which is fast, safe and expressive. It presents several improvements over other low level languages like C and C++, like excellent memory safety without a garbage collector, strong typing, better concurrency support, better module system, and a [blazingly fast](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/rust.html) runtime. This new language with it's attractive features justifies a new astronomical library for use in the future.

Moreover, the [MIT license](https://github.com/saurvs/astro-rust/blob/master/LICENSE.md) adopted here is as liberal as open source licenses get, with the permission to do pretty much anything imaginable as long as due credit is given to the original authors(s) and the same license is passed along to derived works.

## Algorithms

## Contributing

Anyone interested to contribute in any way possible is encouraged to do so. Not all the algorithms in Meeus's book have been implemented yet. Tests along with good documentation need to be written for them as well.

A good start would be to go through Meeus's book, then browse this library's [API documentation](https://saurvs.github.io/astro-rust/astro/index.html), read through the code, and submit a pull request for a new algorithm or modification of an existing one. Refactored code and minor optimizations are also accepted.

An important fact worth mentioning is that the 2nd edition of the book was published in 1998, with only corrections for typos published since. And so, some of the algorithms (and physical constants) used in the book may differ from those used in this library, in favour of those which were adopted by NASA and the IAU recently. Papers published by internationally recognized authorities (like the IAU) ought to be considered as sources for algorithms as well.

The end of goal of this project is to build a modern, well-tested, production-quality code library of algorithms for astronomy.

One fun suggestion in that direction is the addition of the recent [IAU 2000/2006 precession-nutation model](http://62.161.69.131/iers/conv2010/conv2010_c5.html). This method improves upon the existing model implemented here *"by taking into account the effect of mantle anelasticity, ocean tides, electromagnetic couplings produced between the fluid outer core and the mantle as well as between the solid inner core and fluid outer core"*.
