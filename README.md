## About

```astro-rust``` is an MIT licensed library of algorithms useful for rigorous and accurate astronomical calculations.

It includes things such as  planetary, solar and lunar positioning, corrections for precession, nutation, parallax, and aberration, calculating the physical ephemeris of Mars and Jupiter, calculating the elements of the ring system of Saturn, finding position angles, illuminated fractions, visual magnitudes, and times of rise, set and transit of celestial bodies, and much more. Even Pluto's real-time position can be calculated accurately.

## Usage

* Include the crate ```astro``` in your code
  ```rust
  extern crate astro;

  use astro::*;
  ```

* Find the Julian day (the most important step for almost everything)
  ```rust
  // time of the Apollo 11 moon landing

  let day_of_month = time::DayOfMonth{day: 20,
				 			          hr : 20,
                                      min: 18,
                                      sec: 4.0,
                                      time_zone: 0.0 // at Greenwhich
                                     };

  let date = time::Date{year       : 1969,
                        month      : 7, // July
                        decimal_day: time::decimal_day(&day_of_month),
                        cal_type   : time::CalType::Gregorian};

  let julian_day = time::julian_day(&date);

  // if you want to be super accurate, find the Julian Ephemeris day;
  // calculate delta T using the built-in function, or get an observed
  // value from the Astronomical Almanac

  let delta_t = time::approx_delta_t(date.year, date.month);

  let julian_ephm_day = time::julian_emph_day(julian_day, delta_t);
  ```

* Find the *geocentric* ecliptic point and radius vector for the Sun and the Moon
  ```rust
  let (sun_ecl_point, rad_vec_sun) = sun::geocen_ecl_pos(julian_day);

  // sun_ecl_point.long    - ecliptic longitude (radians)
  // sun_ecl_point.lat     - ecliptic latitude (radians)
  // rad_vec_sun - distance between the Sun and the Earth (AU)

  // similarly for the Moon
  let (moon_ecl_point, rad_vec_moon) = lunar::geocen_ecl_pos(julian_day);

  ```

* Find the *heliocentric* coordinates and radius vector for Jupiter
  ```rust
  let (long, lat, rad_vec) = planet::heliocen_pos(&planet::Planet::Jupiter, julian_day);
  ```

* Find the corrections for nutation in ecliptic longitude and obliquity of the ecliptic
  ```rust
  let (nut_in_long, nut_in_oblq) = nutation::nutation(julian_day);
  ```

* Find the geodesic distance between two locations on the Earth
  ```rust
	// geodesic distance between the Observatoire de Paris and
    // the US Naval Observatory at Washington DC

    let paris = coords::GeographPoint{long: angle::deg_frm_dms(-2, 20, 14.0).to_radians(),
                                      lat : angle::deg_frm_dms(48, 50, 11.0).to_radians()};

    let washington = coords::GeographPoint{long: angle::deg_frm_dms(77,  3, 56.0).to_radians(),
                                           lat : angle::deg_frm_dms(38, 55, 17.0).to_radians()};

	// angle::deg_frm_dms() converts degrees expressed in degrees,
	// minutes and seconds into a fractional degree

    let distance = planet::earth::geodesic_dist(&paris, &washington); // in meters
  ```

* Convert equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates
  ```rust
	// equatorial coordinates of the star Pollux

    let right_ascension = 116.328942_f64.to_radians();
    let declination = 28.026183_f64.to_radians();

    // mean obliquity of the ecliptic

    let oblq_eclip = 23.4392911_f64.to_radians();

    // you can also get oblq_eclip from ecliptic::mn_oblq_IAU(julian_day)
    // for the same Julian day when the coordinates of the star
    // were observed

    // also make sure to type #[macro_use] before including the crate
    // to use macros

    // now, convert equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates

    let (ecl_long, ecl_lat) = EclFrmEq!(right_ascension, declination, oblq_eclip);
  ```

* Convert equatorial coordinates to galactic coordinates
  ```rust
	// equatorial coordinates of the Nova Serpentis 1978

    let right_ascension = angle::deg_frm_hms(17, 48, 59.74).to_radians();
    let declination = angle::deg_frm_dms(-14, 43, 8.2).to_radians();

    // convert to galactic coordinates

    let (gal_long, gal_lat) = GalFrmEq!(right_ascension, declination);
  ```

## Contributing

Anyone interested to contribute in any way possible is encouraged to do so. Not all the algorithms in Meeus's book have been implemented yet. Documentation and tests need to be written for them as well. Refactored code and minor optimizations for the existing code are also welcome.

A fun suggestion is the addition of the recent [IAU 2000/2006 precession-nutation model](http://62.161.69.131/iers/conv2010/conv2010_c5.html). This method improves upon the existing model implemented here *"by taking into account the effect of mantle anelasticity, ocean tides, electromagnetic couplings produced between the fluid outer core and the mantle as well as between the solid inner core and fluid outer core"*.
